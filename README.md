In this project I trained a deep neural network on thousands of camera images taken from simulated car while driving it around around the track manually.


This project includes the following work products:

 - model.py - The script used to create and train the model.
- drive.py - The script to drive the car. 
- model.h5 - The saved Keras model. 
- writeup_report as a pdf file. This explains the structure of my network and training approach. The write-up includes examples of images from the dataset in the discussion of the characteristics of the dataset. 
- video.mp4 - A video recording of my vehicle driving autonomously for one lap around the track.

Note this project used the Udacity Behavioural Cloning simulator and AWS provisioned GPU server to run the deep learning models more efficiently.
